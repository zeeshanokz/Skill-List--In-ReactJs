           I am a passionate web developer with hands-on experience in React.js, Next.js, and JavaScript. 
        I enjoy building interactive web applications, learning new technologies, and contributing to 
        projects that solve real-world problems. When not coding, I like to explore new tech trends 
        and improve my skills through tutorials and practice projects.
